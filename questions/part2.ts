Case 1: All distinct letters (e.g. STAI) - C(5,4) * 4! = 120 ways. Case 2: One pair (e.g. SS TA) - C(3,1) * C(4,2) * (4!/2!) = 216 ways. Case 3: Two pairs (e.g. SS TT) - C(3,2) * (4!/(2!2!)) = 18 ways. Case 4: Three alike (e.g. SSS T) - C(2,1) * C(4,1) * (4!/3!) = 32 ways. The sum of these cases is 120 + 216 + 18 + 32 = 386.

      "explanation": "The second quadrant is where x < 0 and y > 0. Statement (1): m < 0. The line slopes downwards. If the y-intercept c is positive, it will pass through Q2. If c is negative or zero, it might not. Insufficient. Statement (2): c > 0. The y-intercept is positive. Any line with a positive y-intercept must pass through the second quadrant (where x is negative) to reach the y-axis, unless it is a vertical line (which is not in the form y=mx+c). Therefore, statement (2) is sufficient."

      "explanation": "This equation holds if either the contents of the absolute value are equal or they are opposites. Case 1: <i>x</i> - 3 = 2<i>x</i> + 1. Solving for <i>x</i> gives -<i>x</i> = 4, so <i>x</i> = -4. Case 2: <i>x</i> - 3 = -(2<i>x</i> + 1). This is <i>x</i> - 3 = -2<i>x</i> - 1. Solving gives 3<i>x</i> = 2, so <i>x</i> = 2/3. The possible values are -4 and 2/3. Of the options, -4 is listed."
